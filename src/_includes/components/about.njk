        <p class="lead">
          We're on a mission to transform our Birstall through the power of
          cycling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cycle Birstall aims to promote cycling as a sustainable, healthy, and
          enjoyable mode of transportation. We believe that by enabling more
          people to cycle, we can reduce traffic congestion, improve air
          quality, enhance our town's health, and create a more connected
          community.
